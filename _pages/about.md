Hello, I'm Kam, and I am excited to introduce myself. I am currently pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering from BNUT, a prestigious university with recognized rankings([look here](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/babol-noshirvani-university-of-technology-529310#:~:text=Babol%20Noshirvani%20University%20of%20Technology%20is%20ranked%20%23598%20in%20Best,about%20how%20we%20rank%20schools.) and [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/babol-noshirvani-university-technology)) worldwide. During my time at BNUT, I have gained valuable research experience in computer vision, image processing, and generative modeling. My passion for these areas has driven me to pursue a PhD in these topics, and I am eager to make a positive impact on the world through my research.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy a variety of hobbies, including playing basketball, reading books, listening to music, and solving daily algorithmic problems. I believe that a well-rounded and balanced lifestyle is essential to achieving success in all aspects of life.
