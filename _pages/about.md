Hello, I'm Kam, and I am excited to introduce myself. I am currently pursuing a degree in electrical engineering from BNUT, a prestigious university with recognized rankings worldwide. During my time at BNUT, I have gained valuable research experience in computer vision, image processing, and generative modeling. My passion for these areas has driven me to pursue a PhD in these topics, and I am eager to make a positive impact on the world through my research.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy a variety of hobbies, including playing basketball, reading books, listening to music, and solving daily algorithmic problems. I believe that a well-rounded and balanced lifestyle is essential to achieving success in all aspects of life.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my webpage. I hope you find the information here informative and engaging, and I look forward to connecting with you soon.
