Hello, I'm Kam, and I am excited to introduce myself. I am pursuing a degree in electrical engineering from [BNUT](https://nit.ac.ir/en), a prestigious university with worldwide rankings ([look here](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/babol-noshirvani-university-of-technology-529310#:~:text=Babol%20Noshirvani%20University%20of%20Technology%20is%20ranked%20%23598%20in%20Best,about%20how%20we%20rank%20schools.) and [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/babol-noshirvani-university-technology)). At BNUT, I gained valuable research experience in computer vision, image processing, and generative modelling. My passion for these areas has driven me to pursue a PhD in these topics, and I am eager to positively impact the world through my research.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy a variety of hobbies, including playing basketball, reading books, listening to music, and solving daily algorithmic problems. A well-rounded and balanced lifestyle is essential to success in all life aspects.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my webpage. I hope you find the information here informative and engaging, and I look forward to connecting with you soon.
