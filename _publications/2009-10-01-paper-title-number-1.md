excerpt: "Visible and infrared image fusion is one of the most challenging problems in image fusion. This technique combines the information from visible and infrared images into one single image. This paper proposes an update to a successful technique, GANMcC, to achieve more significant results. GANMcC gives equal attention to contrast and gradient information in visible and infrared images, respectively. The proposed method aims to reinforce the contrast information to the architectur
